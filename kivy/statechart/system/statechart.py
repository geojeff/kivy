  @class

  The startchart manager mixin allows an object to be a statechart. By becoming a statechart, the
  object can then be manage a set of its own states.
  
  This implementation of the statechart manager closely follows the concepts stated in D. Harel's 
  original paper "Statecharts: A Visual Formalism For Complex Systems" 
  (www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/papers/Statecharts.pdf). 
  
  The statechart allows for complex state heircharies by nesting states within states, and 
  allows for state orthogonality based on the use of concurrent states.
  
  At minimum, a statechart must have one state: The root state. All other states in the statechart
  are a decendents (substates) of the root state.
  
  The following example shows how states are nested within a statechart:
  
      MyApp.Statechart = Object.extend(StatechartManager, {
        rootState: State.design({
          initialSubstate: 'stateA',

          stateA: State.design({
            # ... can continue to nest further states
          }),
        
          stateB: State.design({
            # ... can continue to nest further states
          })
        })
      });
  
  Note how in the example above, the root state as an explicit initial substate to enter into. If no
  initial substate is provided, then the statechart will default to the the state's first substate.
  
  You can also defined states without explicitly defining the root state. To do so, simply create properties
  on your object that represents states. Upon initialization, a root state will be constructed automatically
  by the mixin and make the states on the object substates of the root state. As an example:
  
      MyApp.Statechart = Object.extend(StatechartManager, {
        initialState: 'stateA',

        stateA: State.design({
          # ... can continue to nest further states
        }),
      
        stateB: State.design({
          # ... can continue to nest further states
        })
      });
  
  If you liked to specify a class that should be used as the root state but using the above method to defined
  states, you can set the rootStateExample property with a class that extends from State. If the 
  rootStateExample property is not explicitly assigned the then default class used will be State.
  
  To provide your statechart with orthogonality, you use concurrent states. If you use concurrent states,
  then your statechart will have multiple current states. That is because each concurrent state represents an
  independent state structure from other concurrent states. The following example shows how to provide your
  statechart with concurrent states:
  
      MyApp.Statechart = Object.extend(StatechartManager, {
        rootState: State.design({
          substatesAreConcurrent: True,

          stateA: State.design({
            # ... can continue to nest further states
          }),
        
          stateB: State.design({
            # ... can continue to nest further states
          })
        })
      });
  
  Above, to indicate that a state's substates are concurrent, you just have to set the substatesAreConcurrent to 
  True. Once done, then stateA and stateB will be independent of each other and each will manage their
  own current substates. The root state will then have more then one current substate.
  
  To define concurrent states directly on the object without explicitly defining a root, you can do the 
  following:
  
      MyApp.Statechart = Object.extend(StatechartManager, {
        statesAreConcurrent: True,

        stateA: State.design({
          # ... can continue to nest further states
        }),
    
        stateB: State.design({
          # ... can continue to nest further states
        })
      });
  
  Remember that a startchart can have a mixture of nested and concurrent states in order for you to 
  create as complex of statecharts that suite your needs. Here is an example of a mixed state structure:
  
      MyApp.Statechart = Object.extend(StatechartManager, {
        rootState: State.design({
          initialSubstate: 'stateA',

          stateA: State.design({
            substatesAreConcurrent: True,

            stateM: State.design({ ... })
            stateN: State.design({ ... })
            stateO: State.design({ ... })
          }),
        
          stateB: State.design({
            initialSubstate: 'stateX',

            stateX: State.design({ ... })
            stateY: State.desgin({ ... })
          })
        })
      });
  
  Depending on your needs, a statechart can have lots of states, which can become hard to manage all within
  one file. To modularize your states and make them easier to manage and maintain, you can plug-in states
  into other states. Let's say we are using the statechart in the last example above, and all the code is 
  within one file. We could update the code and split the logic across two or more files like so:

      # state_a.js

      MyApp.StateA = State.extend({
        substatesAreConcurrent: True,

        stateM: State.design({ ... })
        stateN: State.design({ ... })
        stateO: State.design({ ... })
      });

      # state_b.js

      MyApp.StateB = State.extend({
        substatesAreConcurrent: True,

        stateM: State.design({ ... })
        stateN: State.design({ ... })
        stateO: State.design({ ... })
      });

      # statechart.js

      MyApp.Statechart = Object.extend(StatechartManager, {
        rootState: State.design({
          initialSubstate: 'stateA',
          stateA: State.plugin('MyApp.StateA'),
          stateB: State.plugin('MyApp.StateB')
        })
      });

  Using state plug-in functionality is optional. If you use the plug-in feature you can break up your statechart
  into as many files as you see fit.

      to provide a current state in which to start from.
      
      When using history states, the statechart will first make transitions to the given state and then use that
      state's history state and recursively follow each history state's history state until there are no

      Used to invoke a method on current states. If the method can not be executed
      on a current state, then the state's parent states will be tried in order
      of closest ancestry.
          
      A few notes: 
          
       1. Calling this is not the same as calling sendEvent or sendAction.
          Rather, this should be seen as calling normal methods on a state that 
          will *not* call gotoState or gotoHistoryState.
       2. A state will only ever be invoked once per call. So if there are two 
          or more current states that have the same parent state, then that parent 
          state will only be invoked once if none of the current states are able
          to invoke the given method.
          
      When calling this method, you are able to supply zero ore more arguments
      that can be pass onto the method called on the states. As an example
          
          invokeStateMethod('render', context, firstTime);
      
      The above call will invoke the render method on the current states
      and supply the context and firstTime arguments to the method. 
          
      Because a statechart can have more than one current state and the method 
      invoked may return a value, the addition of a callback function may be provided 
      in order to handle the returned value for each state. As an example, let's say
      we want to call a calculate method on the current states where the method
      will return a value when invoked. We can handle the returned values like so:
          
          invokeStateMethod('calculate', value, function(state, result) {
            # .. handle the result returned from calculate that was invoked
            #    on the given state
          })
          
      If the method invoked does not return a value and a callback function is
      supplied, then result value will simply be undefined. In all cases, if
      a callback function is given, it must be the last value supplied to this
      method.
          
      invokeStateMethod will return a value if only one state was able to have 
      the given method invoked on it, otherwise no value is returned. 
          
      @param methodName {String} methodName a method name
      @param args {Object...} Optional. any additional arguments
      @param func {Function} Optional. a callback function. Must be the last
             value supplied if provided.
             
      @returns a value if the number of current states is one, otherwise undefined
               is returned. The value is the result of the method that got invoked
               on a state.
